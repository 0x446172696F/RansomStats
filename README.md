# RansomStats
Inspired by https://github.com/colincowie/LeakSiteAnalytics

I wanted to create a simple HTML page that shows the stats for current day, week, month and year in a graph and in a table with the title.


With the help of ChatGPT I created the required code for the filters. The favicon was created with Dall-E



This project was mostly made to learn some more Python/HTML and to get a chance to work with ChatGPT and Dall-E.

*Disclaimer: I'm not a developer, the functionality in this script could probably be achieved with half the lines of code.*
